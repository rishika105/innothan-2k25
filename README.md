# Problem Statement

Urban transportation systems are experiencing exponential growth in congestion, driven by the disintegration of
urban mobility networks and an increasing demand for multimodal transit. Existing traffic systems are predominantly
centralized and rely on fixed-response algorithms, failing to address dynamic traffic conditions and variable
congestion patterns. This exacerbates the inefficiencies in both fuel consumption and urban air quality, which current
systems are incapable of mitigating through real-time, data-driven intelligence. The challenge lies in integrating
cyber-physical systems, multi-source data analytics, and predictive traffic flow algorithms into an adaptive, realtime system capable of managing autonomous vehicles, ride-sharing fleets, and public transit simultaneously.

# Challenge

How can an AI-driven cyber-physical system integrate real-time traffic data, connected vehicle intelligence, and
decentralized decision-making to optimize urban mobility and congestion management while balancing centralized
control with edge autonomy?
